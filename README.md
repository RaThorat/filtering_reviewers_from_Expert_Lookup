# Proposal Reviewer Selector
Funders use Elsevier Expert Lookup for a list of reviewers for submitted research proposals. It still takes a lot of time to check whether the selected reviewers from Expert Lookup are already in contact with the funder or whether they have already assessed a proposal from the funder.

With the script a funder can easily filter list of reviewers from Expert Lookup from funderÂ´s database.

You must have a list of reviewers for the relevant proposal as a csv file, downloaded from Expert Lookup. In addition, you use the excel files of proposal information, reviewers suggested and blocked by the applicant and reviewers from the funder's database. These are in total five input files.

Empty examples of files (applicant info, reviewers from Expert Lookup, suggested reviewers, blocked reviewers, database) with their column name is given in the github repository.

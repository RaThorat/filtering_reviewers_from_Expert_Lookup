# filtering_reviewers_from_Expert_Lookup
Funders use Expert Lookup for a list of reviewers for submitted research proposals. It still takes a lot of time to check whether the selected reviewers from Expert Lookup have already in contact with the funder or whether they have already assessed a proposal.  With this code a funder can easily filter list of reviewers.
